# NeuralNet
A simple (and hopefully) clear implementation of neural networks, to understand how they work.

Contents:
* A simple [2 layer Neural Net](https://github.com/harokb/NeuralNet/blob/master/NeuralNet.py) (to start learning), then a [n-layer Neural Net](https://github.com/harokb/NeuralNet/blob/master/GeneralNeuralNet.py)
* Prediction and training, using the classical backpropagation algorithm (with momentum)
* Examples: the [XOR function](https://github.com/harokb/NeuralNet/blob/master/xor.py), a [simple OCR system](https://github.com/harokb/NeuralNet/blob/master/ocr.py)
* Ability to [test different designs](https://github.com/harokb/NeuralNet/blob/master/neural_network_design.py) and [make pretty graphs](https://github.com/harokb/NeuralNet/blob/master/show_graph.py)

This repository is the companion to my [blog posts about learning how neural networks work and learn](https://bonaert.tk/starter-guide-to-neural-networks-part-1/).
